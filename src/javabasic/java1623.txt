In Java, the main method is the starting point of a Java program. It is a special method that is called by the Java runtime when the program is executed.

The main method has the following signature:


public static void main(String[] args)

The public keyword indicates that the method is visible and can be called from anywhere. The static keyword indicates that the method is a class method and can be called without creating an instance of the class. The void keyword indicates that the method does not return a value.

The String[] args parameter is an array of String objects that contains any command-line arguments passed to the program.

In the line of code you provided, the throws IOException keyword is added to the main method declaration. This means that the main method is declaring that it might throw an IOException. An IOException is a type of exception that is thrown when an input/output error occurs.

If a method declares that it throws an exception, the calling method must either handle the exception or declare that it also throws the exception. In this case, if the main method throws an IOException, the Java runtime will handle the exception.

The main method is the entry point of a Java program and is where the program's logic begins. It is required for all Java programs and must be included in order for the program to run.
